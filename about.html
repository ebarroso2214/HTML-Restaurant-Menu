            <p>The owner of this establishment was a normal man, trying to make ends meet. He liked Thai food and also liked coding. So he decided to one day open up their very first restaurant in Hackensack NJ since it was his hometown. He decided it needed a witty coding related name. He tried many options but none ever seemed to fit. Until one day he thought of a great, witty, catchy, and funny name! Thus lead to the birth of H-Thai-ML!</p>
